# Cross Course Project

![](c:%5CUsers%5Ckarlm%5COneDrive%5CBilder%5CGameHubImage.PNG)

A cross course project to test our knowledge in design, HTML and CSS. There is also an appendix that added JS to the project at a later date.

# Description

This project set out to test our ability to design a webpage that was centered on sales and commerce. The goal of the page is to sell a product to the customer and make this process as easy as possible for them. There is a cart, account and contact page which are commonplace on eCommerce sites however there is limited functionality since this is more a design project than a technical project.
The appendix to the project added fetching data from an API that contains the data on the products so that this can be managed remotely from the site itself.

# Built with:
